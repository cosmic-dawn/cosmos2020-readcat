# Noetbook for COSMOS2020 catalogue analysis
A basic script to get started with the COSMOS2020 catalogue. It shows how to modify photometry, plot galaxy physical quantities, etc.

## How to use it
Astronomers can use this Notebook as a starting point for their work with the COSMOS2020 catalogue, which can be downloaded from [this data repository](http://www.link_to_catalog.com). You also need the ancillary files included in the present repository, namely: ... With minimal modifications the code can process any other galaxy catalogues released in standard formats.

The Notebook is divided in the following sections:

- **Data preparation**: basic manipulation of the photometry (MW extinction, data cleaning, rescaling to total flux)
- **Data visualization**: sky map, redshift and color distributions, SED fitting
- **Classic diagnostics**: color-color diagrams, SFR vs. M* diagram, ...
