# Noetbook for COSMOS2020 catalogue analysis
A basic script to get started with the COSMOS2020 catalogue. It shows how to modify photometry, plot galaxy physical quantities, etc. Written by D. Blanquez, I. Davidzon, G. Magdis.

## Outline

With the present Notebook the user is able to extract valuable information from the COSMOS2020 catalogue, which can be downloaded from [the official data repository](https://cosmos2020.calet.org/). This is also a convenient starting point for further analysis. With minimal modifications the code can be useful to study others galaxy catalogues. 

The Notebook is divided in the following sections:

* **Introduction**: loading the tables and selecting the columns
* **Data preparation**: basic manipulations/corrections of the original photometry
* **Data visualization**: sky map, redshift and color distributions, SED fitting
* **Classic diagnostics**: color-color diagrams, SFR vs. M* diagram, ...
* **A simple machine-learning application**: prducing "mock photometry" by means of Gaussian Mixtures
